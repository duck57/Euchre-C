# Euchre-C
Double-deck Euchre in C

Map of intended structure is here: https://mm.tt/612161846?t=W05KonczMg

I started this project sometime in early 2014 (or so Xcode tells me: created @ end of March, 2014).
Currently, I've got 4 AI players with some rudimentary AI for bidding.  Current projects are to give more intelligent AI for picking cards, then implement human interface and driver menus.

The overall euchre.us project is supposed to be similar to the [99 Bottles of Beer project](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net) (also on [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer), except as an implemnetation of double-deck (bid) euchre.  See RULES for the specific rules that are implemented.

See https://github.com/EuchreUS/euchre-us/ for the "home" of the project and for links to other languages.
